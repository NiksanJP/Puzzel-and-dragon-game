# Puzzel-and-dragon-game-try
This is an old project, I made this project when I jut started programming. There might be some errors and stupid decisions made when making this code. Feel free to use this.

# Main Source Code
As you can see this a begginer's code. Don't hate on 16 years old me. There are mistakes for sure.
The code is in Source.cpp.
Run the code using C++ compiler.

# Special Characters
The code has special symbols that may be not possible to be generated by normal machines. I had to change my keyboards to Japanese that accepts special characters, then I selected MSゴシック font in the running window of C++.
